# AuthenticateS
Electronic authentication, often referred to as e-authentication, involves verifying the identity of users in online systems. There are various methods for e-authentication, including username/password, biometrics, multi-factor authentication, and more. In Java, you can implement a basic username/password authentication system as an example. Keep in mind that in a real-world scenario, you would typically use more secure authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth, JWT, or integration with identity providers.
